#### Description:

For this final project I have decided to create a program for keep track of a patient's fever. It is called Fever Tracker, and it has two versions, a CLI version and a GUI version.

This is a simple program that attempts to help the user minimize the sometimes overwhelming task of checking a family member's fever. 
It does that task by saving the data to a csv file and giving the user the option to create a pdf file with the formatted data.

In the CLI version of the program, we initially have to choose between 5 options: create a fever log, add temperature to an existing log, check an existing log, convert a csv file log to a pdf file, or exit the program.

When we want to open an existing record, the program asks us to choose between the files that are saved in the csv file folder. Then, in the CLI version of the program, the data is displayed in a formatted table style directly in the terminal shell. 

This program works with the csv, pdf and tabulate modules of Python. The tabulate module helps us to display the data to the user in the formatted table style in an elegant way.

It has been a good challenge in which I have learned a lot and that will allow me to continue learning.

There are some bugs creating the pdf file or validating input data, but since the goal is to continue learning, I can't spend much more time on it.
